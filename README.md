file name for this assignment is the index.js
sets up a server to listen on a specified port (defaulting to 3000 if not provided in the environment variables), and includes a generic 404 error handler to manage requests to undefined routes, responding with a "404 - Not Found" message. 
Once running, the server will log a message indicating that it is listening on the specified port or the default port 3000. You can then access the server through a web browser or tools like curl or Postman, and any undefined routes will trigger the 404 error handler.
